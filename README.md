# Apartment-Calculator
A simple calculator used to figure out the cost difference in apartments

# What is this?
This program calculates the cost of an apartment based off a number of variables and compares the cost of the apartment with the cost of two on-campus housing locations at Iowa State University.

# Why did you make this?
I made this to figure out the most cost efficient place to live during the 2016 school year.

# How do I use this?
You probably won't. It's set up in a very-specific way that most likely doesn't match your situation at all. If you want to modify the variables for use in your situation however, please feel free to!

# Why did you upload this?
For archivial purposes. Mainly for my resume.

# Changelog
